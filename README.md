leJOS Java projects for the Lego Mindstorms EV3

This is where I store my LEGO Mindstorms EV3 programming projects in leJOS.

What's here?

### leJOS WebCam fun

* OpenCVTesting - code to grab images from a webcam, detect faces in the images and then stream that back to a web connection
* SurveillanceCam - Surveillance Camera demo code that uses the leJOS webcam support to capture a frame and overlay the current date/time and battery voltage level, and then save to Dropbox
* CameraTest - simple example of capturing video from a webcam in leJOS and drawing it on the LCD screen on the EV3
* DisplayStreamingVideo - code from the leJOS tutorials to display a streaming video stream from the webcam on the EV3 in a Java application window
* StreamVideo - send video frames as fast as possible from the webcam to a remote host. Fast means about 3 fps.
* Wand3r3r - code for an autonomous wandering differential drive robot that captures images using a webcam

### Older Projects

* SpaceInvaders - my Space Invaders projects where you play the game using an EV3
